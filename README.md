Current features:
- Save and load pre-planned combats
- Add, edit and save PC's and NPC's
- Custom icons and borders for your combatants
- Apply conditions during combat
- Damage vulnerabilities, resistances and immunities accounted for in damage calculations
- Temporary vulnerabilities, resistances and immunities can be added during combat
- Temporary HP system
- Combat and turn timer
- Web based player view which can be cast from the browser or displayed on any device connected to the same WiFi

Planned features:
- Full stats and round my round output with turn breakdowns and per player statistics
- Music controls and playlists linked to saved combats
- Player view animations for a more immersive experience
- Random combat generator

The program is still under development so there are some bugs to iron out.

## Issues
A knowns issues is that the browser will not automatically open on Windows systems. So you will have to open the broweser yourself and go to the address shown on the combat screen.
